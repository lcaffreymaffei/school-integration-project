# seda-data
OVERVIEW: 
Ongoing project studying the relationship between school integration and learning outcomes for historically underperforming students using SEDA data

Current code includes data cleaning of four datasets, downloaded from <a href='https://edopportunity.org/get-the-data/seda-archive-downloads/'>SEDA </a>, containing national testing and demographic data. Two school-level datasets, one with testing data and one with demographic data, are cleaned and combined. The same is done for the district-level equivalent datasets. The end result is two datasets: one with district-level data and one with school-level data.
